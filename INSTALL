To install this script just place the entire content of the bin
directory, including the withsome-util subdirectory and its files, on
your path. Either modify your path with something like:

export PATH=$PATH:~/withsome/bin

or copy the content with a command like

cp -r /home/my_account_home/withsome/bin/* /usr/local/something_on_my_path/

That's it!

Don't forget to run the included tests BEFORE installing by running
t/t.sh. The last two tests have many requirements, including sudo, as
well as pre-requisites so don't worry if those two don't run.
